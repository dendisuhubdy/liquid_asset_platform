# Liquid Asset Platform

Liquid Asset Platform allows the Issuer to issue their own custom token assets powered 
by the Liquid sidechain. These assets could represent loyalty points, 
tokenized fiat, tokenized altcoins, crypto assets, digital collectibles, 
attested assets like gold, property etc. 

There are multiple different ways through which the end user can get the 
tokenized assets. They can either get the assets for free because 
they are a loyal customer or won some contest. 
Buyer can also directly purchase the asset from the Issuer by paying using liquid bitcoin.
